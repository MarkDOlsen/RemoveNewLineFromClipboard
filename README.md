# Remove Line Braks from Clipboard Text
Takes the text currently on the Windows clipboard and strips out newline characters.

## Why?
I am frequently copying and pasting text from PDFs and the result is a jagged mess of linebreaks from the column structure
of the PDF.  I can keep this little program open and just click the "strip newlines" button before I paste into my target
document to remove those extra line breaks and it saves me a ton of time cleaning them up the result in my target document.

## Output
- Displays the modified tect in the window, both to show it is done and to allow a quick review of what it did.
- The modified tect is copied back to the clipboard automatically so it can be pasted via control + v as usual.
